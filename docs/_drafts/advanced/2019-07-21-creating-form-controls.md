You should be creating form controls that emulate native form controls as closely as possible.

## Basic example

## Props given to form controls

## Creating better form controls

## Configuring Labels

<div class="text-center mt-7">
  <a class="btn" href="#">
    Begin validating forms
  </a>
</div>

    <h2>üòç Native browser APIs <em>(and so can you!)</em></h2>
    <p>One of the most appealing features of Reactive Record is its reliance on native browser events to trigger form actions.</p>
    <p>Browsers, like many desktop applications, have had accessibility built right in to them from the start. Users have expectations about hitting the <samp>Return</samp> key to submit a form or tabbing through form controls in a sensible order. We should work as hard as we can to not upset these expectations, or provide a poor user experience. So we should avoid overriding or circumventing native browser events. That's why Reactive Record uses a real <samp>&lt;form&gt;</samp> element in the DOM.</p>
    <p>Additionally, you may not need as much control over form controls as you've previously been told. Believe it or not, <strong>it's rare that you'd need to <samp>setState()</samp> every time a key is pressed</strong>. You'll know it when you need it, but in most cases, this is a needless memory hog that can lead to laggy typing.</p>
    <p>Native form controls have similar qualities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        They manage their own state internally (so avoid bringing your own). That is:
        <ul>
          <li>Text inputs have their own internal value and Undo / Redo functionality</li>
          <li>Checkboxes and radios keep their own state and respond to <samp>.checked</samp></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>They all have a <samp>.value</samp> method.</li>
      <li>They all have an activated state</li>
      <li>They're included in the tab index, and are keyboard navigable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're going to build your own form control, it should share these qualities! You won't need to teach anyone how to use your special form control. If you stick to these expectations, your form control can be plug-and-play.</p>
